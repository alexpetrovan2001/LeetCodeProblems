# LeetCodeProblems

Solved problems from leetcode

You can check every branch for different subjects. 
Each problem should have the result from leetcode (time and memory details).
Some problems have more than one solution, each with it's pros and cons (some have better time scores and some have better memory scores).

Most of the solutions have been found by me, without using any AI-tools or without being inspired from other solutions. 
Of course, some problems posed some challanges and if I was thinking for more than 10 mins to it without any progress
I would search for hints here and there, but there was no copy&paste to any problem. :) 

Feel free to explore the branches for various subjects and dive into the solutions.
